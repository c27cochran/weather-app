This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

All prerequisites can be found ðŸ‘†

## **TL;DR**

1. `git clone` this repo.
2. Change dir `cd weather-app`.
3. Run `yarn` and wait for packages to download.
4. Run `yarn start`.  

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

Your app is ready to be deployed!

## Instructions

Hopefully, it's pretty self-explanatory to use:

- Input a United States city (and/or state), hit enter or click the search icon.

**OR**

- Click the "FIND ME" button and weather should appear.*

_*Note: you must enable browser location tracking. However, to see the error message, feel free
  to disable it._ 

#### Easter Egg

- Type in "snow" in the text field to use hard-coded data. You will see a nice example of how
 the UI changes based on weather.
